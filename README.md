# TS3Scripts

All this scripts require PHP to run. If you don't have PHP installed yet, you can install it via apt install php on Linux Debian and Ubuntu.

When the script is running you can connect to it via your TeamSpeak 3 Client.

If you have any questions about the scripts, you can contact me on ts-thebeast.net

## ts3serverclientcrashertill3.1.6.php

You can simply download the script and start it with PHP:

root@VPS:~# php ts3serverclientcrashertill3.1.6.php

This script sends the connecting client an RSA puzzle which it cannot solve. The client will crash completely.

## ts3serverclientcrashertill3.1.7.php

Already working. Not public yet.
